Alright - so, basically what you need to do it install this is simply just:
 1. Download .css file. (Probably sent to you on Discord anyway)
 2. Open 'Run' (WIN + R)
 3. Type '%appdata%'
 4. Find 'BetterDiscord'
 5. Go to 'Themes'
 6. Put the .css file in there.
 7. Open Discord.
 8. Refresh.
 9. Theme should be there.
 10. Enable theme.

Enjoy the theme, any errors let me know and I'll fix them asap.
